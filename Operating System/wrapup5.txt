 Wrapup of multithreading basics and miscellany

-- Wrapup

 # Multithreading can be a highly efficient way to do concurrent programming,
   as thread-level context switches are very cheap.
   ## It's the preferred approach to concurrency in 
      languages such as Java and C#.
       -->every language suppports different forms 
          of multitasking/concurrency and mainly, 
          threads/multithreading 
       -->some of these support multiple processes 
          as well as multiple threads 
 # Multithreading has twin challenges for the programmer:
   ## Avoid race conditions by ensuring that multiple threads don't access shared
      memory locations in inappropriate ways.
      ### Ensure that critical sections are executed in single-threaded mode.
      
   ## Avoid 'over synchronization' that degrades performance and may result in deadlock.

 # Languages now offer programmers high-level constructs and types to ease the challenges
   of multithreaded programming.
   ## But sometimes a simple mutex is still the way to go.
 
-- Native versus green threads, and the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

 # A 'native thread' of a language is under 
   kernel OS control when it comes to scheduling.
   ## Since roughly 2000, Java Thread instances map to 
      'native' threads. (Same for C#.)
   
   ## C's 'pthreads' (the 'p' for POSIX API standardization) are 'native' threads.

 # A 'green thread' (aka 'microthread', 'tasklet') is under a particular language's runtime control.
   ## In effect, 'green threads' emulate native threads, and may provide better
      performance for operations such as thread creation and synchronization.
	  
   ## Prior to version 1.9, for example, Ruby's standard implementation (CRuby) had only green threads.

 # A GIL is a mechanism (in implementation, a mutex) that a runtime uses to allow only one
   thread to execute at a time, even in a multithreaded environment: no thread-level parallelism.
   ## The standard implementations of Ruby (CRuby) and Python (CPython) have a GIL.
