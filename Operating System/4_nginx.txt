 Multiprocessing in production-grade software: the nginx web server
#### here multiprocessing means, using several processes, for 
     multitasking 
 # www.nginx.com
   ## The web server is written in C.
   ## nginx combines multiprocessing and 
      non-blocking I/O as concurrency mechanisms.

 # nginx, like any modern web server that relies on 
   multiprocessing for concurrency,
   is a "pre-forking" server.
   ## nginx can be started as a 'system service' (at boot time), 
      and is platform-neutral.

 # nginx.conf                ##  configuration entries are key/value pairs: no XML!

    user www-data;           ## www-data (name is arbitrary) is owner of workers
    worker_processes 4;      ## default number of workers, might be set to processor count
    pid /var/run/nginx.pid;  ## file /var/run/nginx.pid stores pid of master process

    events {
       worker_connections 1024;  ## Max of 1024 connections per worker 
       ...                       ## (typical browsers open at least two connections to a site per client session)
    }   

 # ps -ef | grep nginx
