 System call overview for concurrency, parallelism, and non-blocking I/O

 # The systems context: user-space and kernel-space code
   ## User-space code does not control shared physical resources 
      (processors, memory, I/O devices).
   ### Ordinary applications execute in user space.
   
   ## Kernel-space code comprises the core OS routines 
      that control shared physical resources.

   ## A "system call" originates in user-space, but results 
      in the execution of a kernel-space routine.
      ### Standard library functions (user-space) mediate 
          between ordinary application code and
	  the core OS routines (kernel-space) that 
          some library functions call.
		  
      ### The standard library goes by various names: on Unix-type systems, libc 
          or variants thereof
          (e.g., glibc on Ubuntu); on Windows, the Windows API or variants thereof (e.g., Win32 API)

   ## Depiction: Node.js app calls the cluster.fork() function

                                                                   |     ## in modern Linux, named clone

 # How many library functions make system calls?
   ## Not every library function makes a system call, e.g., strlen("foobar") does not.
   ## Of the 2,000 or so library functions, about 400 result in system calls.

 # Back to an earlier question: Why C?
  
    The standard libraries and kernel routines are written mostly in C, with some assembly language or
    non-standard C extensions covering the rest.
