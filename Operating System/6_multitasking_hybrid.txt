 Hybrid approaches

 # There's no hard-and-fast rule about how best to support concurrency.
   ## Multiprocessing, multithreading, and non-blocking I/O can be used in various combinations.

 # Sample hybrids
   ## "Multiprocessing" + "multithreading": IIS (Windows web server) and AspNet runtime

   	      client side                         server side
   	    +-------------+  HTTP requests    +-----------------+
    	    | web browser |------------------>| Web server (IIS)|
   	    |             |<------------------|                 |
   	    +-------------+  HTTP responses   +-------+---------+
   	                                              |
   	                                        aspnet_isapi.dll            ## Links IIS process with workers
   	                                              |
   	                                              +--- aspnet_wp.exe    ## worker process 1
   	                                              |
   	                                              +--- aspnet_wp.exe    ## worker process 2
   	                                              ...                   ...

        ### Each worker process is multithreaded 
     -----> (by default, 10 threads per worker process), and 
     --------> each thread handles a single request 
            (the 'one-thread-per-request' model)

   ## "Multiprocessing" + "non-blocking I/O": nginx
      ### Multiprocessing:
	  #### nginx has a 'master process' to read configuration files and to watch over worker processes
               (e.g., start a new worker if one happens to die unexpectedly).
          #### A 'worker process' handles a client request: a given worker may handle even
	       thousands of requests concurrently--given the efficiency of non-blocking I/O.
          #### Other (optional) processes (e.g., a cache loader and a cache manager) also are in play.

      ### Non-blocking I/O:
	  #### The workers employ non-blocking I/O in handling requests, each of which is partitioned
 	       into a collection of sub-requests. A completed sub-request generates an event, which is
	       handled in the course of assembling a full response out of pieces.

   ## Non-blocking I/O + multithreading (under the hood): Node.js

                         Node.js server  ## a single-threaded process managing an event loop
          client request  +--------+
	 ---------------->|        |     ## 'workers' are JavaScript functions that read and
	       ...        | event           otherwise handle a client's request using non-blocking I/O
	  client request  | loop   |        and callbacks to signal task completion
         ---------------->|        |
			  +--------+     ## Long-running tasks (e.g., accessing a DB) are delegated to
					    under-the-hood threads, with callbacks to signal task completion
